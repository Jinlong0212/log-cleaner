# 🧹 Log Cleaner

A Bash script that scans log files, extracts important error messages, and generates a clean, readable error report.

## 📌 Overview

Log files often contain thousands of mixed entries, making it difficult to quickly locate real problems.
This script solves that issue by:

- Searching for ERROR and FAILURE lines

- Removing duplicate entries

- Sorting results

- Producing a clean output file for debugging

This project demonstrates practical Bash scripting and text-processing skills — perfect as a portfolio piece for employers.
